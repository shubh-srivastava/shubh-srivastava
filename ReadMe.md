## 👋 About Me

I’m Shubh Srivastava, a Computer Science student with strong problem-solving skills and hands-on experience in C++, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I enjoy building end-to-end systems that combine solid algorithms with real-world applications, with particular interest in Blockchain, Cryptography (Zero-Knowledge Proofs), Machine Learning, and modern web development using React. I focus on writing clean, optimized, and scalable code while continuously learning advanced system design and security concepts.
